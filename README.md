### Overview

OntoDM-algorithms is an ontology that formalizes knowledge in the field of machine learning (ML) and data mining (DM), with a focus on predictive modelling algorithms.
It is expressed in OWL-DL, a de facto standard for representing ontologies. It has 361 classes, 300 of which are external, i.e., reused from the referenced ontologies, while 61 are newly added.  
It is a part of the [BioPortal](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/ONTODM-ALGORITHM) repository of biomedical ontologies.

OntoDM-algorithms provided the backbone for the semantic annotation schema that was used for developing the [ML Algorithms Annotator](https://github.com/lidija-jovanovska/ml-algorithms-annotator).

### More info.

The design of the ontology is described in detail in Chapter 3 in my MSc thesis (p. 21).
